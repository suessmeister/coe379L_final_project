The 2 machine learning models can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. 


The dataset folder contains both the training set (data) as well as the validation set (valid/valid_same_speaker). The validation set was not included in the training of the model.


The 2 files written in C that run the model are also present. I decided to omit the other system generated C files that would have cluttered the repo, but will be in the presentation. Everything except for whatever is inside of the while(1) loop are system-generated by manual configurations I set up previously. 


In the statistics folder, you will see 2 files both containing the sizes of each model, as well as detailed metrics about RAM usage, Neural Network Layer Size and other general architecture information.
